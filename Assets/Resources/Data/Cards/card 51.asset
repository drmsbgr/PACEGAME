  question: What is the relationship between climate change and ocean acidification?
  information: Ocean acidification occurs when oceans absorb excess carbon dioxide
    from the atmosphere, leading to a decrease in seawater pH levels. This phenomenon
    threatens marine organisms, particularly coral reefs and shellfish, that rely
    on calcium carbonate for their structures. Both climate change and ocean acidification
    reduce the resilience of marine ecosystems.
