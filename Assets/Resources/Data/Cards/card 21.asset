  question: What are the main components of the atmosphere that affect air quality?
  information: The primary components of the atmosphere that affect air quality are
    nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), and carbon dioxide (approximately 0.04%). Additionally,
    pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs),
    and ozone (O3) are significant indicators of air quality. Each of these components
    can have different effects on respiratory health; for example, PM can reach the
    lungs and lead to various respiratory issues.
