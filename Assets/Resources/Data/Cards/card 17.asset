  question: How do ocean microorganisms contribute to the carbon cycle?
  information: Ocean microorganisms play a critical role in breaking down organic
    matter and participating in nutrient cycling, which is essential for the carbon
    cycle. These microorganisms not only help maintain the health of marine ecosystems
    but also enhance carbon absorption, contributing to climate change mitigation.
