  question: What is the relationship between air quality and economic development?
  information: The relationship between air quality and economic development is complex.
    Rapid industrialization can increase levels of air pollution, while efforts to
    improve air quality may initially hinder economic growth. However, adopting clean
    air policies can ultimately enhance public health, leading to increased productivity
    and economic efficiency. Sustainable development aims to balance these two factors.
