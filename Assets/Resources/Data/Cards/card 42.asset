  question: What is the role of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and which gases
    fall under this category?
  information: Greenhouse gases are gases in the atmosphere that trap heat. Carbon
    dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and water vapor are among
    the key greenhouse gases. They allow sunlight to enter the Earth while preventing
    some of the heat from escaping back into space, thereby maintaining the planet's
    temperature.
