  question: What is the relationship between air quality and climate change?
  information: The relationship between air quality and climate change is complex.
    Climate change can influence weather and atmospheric conditions, affecting the
    formation and distribution of pollutants. For instance, rising temperatures can
    increase ozone levels, while certain pollutants can contribute to the greenhouse
    effect, accelerating climate change. Thus, managing air quality is also significant
    in the fight against climate change.
