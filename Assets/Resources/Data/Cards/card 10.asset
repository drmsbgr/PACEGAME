  question: How does the food chain in oceans work?
  information: The food chain in oceans begins with phytoplankton and includes various
    organisms like zooplankton, small fish, larger fish, and marine mammals. Each
    level of life serves as a food source for the next, maintaining the balance of
    the ecosystem. A healthy food chain is essential for the sustainability of the
    seas.
