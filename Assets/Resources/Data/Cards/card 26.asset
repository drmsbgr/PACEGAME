  question: What technologies are used to monitor air quality?
  information: Various technologies are employed to monitor air quality. Ground-based
    monitoring stations continuously measure air quality in specific areas, while
    remote sensing technology allows for the observation of large areas via satellites
    and balloons. Mobile sensors provide real-time air quality data collection, enabling
    more dynamic assessments. All these technologies contribute to the monitoring
    and management of air quality.
