  question: How can climate change affect species distribution within ecosystems?
  information: Climate change can lead to shifts in the distribution of species due
    to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. Some species may migrate
    to cooler or higher altitudes, while others may find it challenging to adapt.
    This situation can lead to disruptions in ecosystem dynamics and local extinctions.
