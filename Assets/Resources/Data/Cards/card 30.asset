  question: How can vegetation improve air quality?
  information: Vegetation plays a crucial role in enhancing air quality. Trees and
    plants absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis while releasing oxygen. Additionally,
    plants can absorb airborne particulate matter and pollutants, preventing them
    from remaining suspended in the air. Increasing green spaces can improve air
    quality in urban areas, supporting public health.
