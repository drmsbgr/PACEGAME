  question: What challenges exist in accurately measuring air quality?
  information: Accurately measuring air quality presents various challenges. For
    example, pollutant concentrations can vary over time and space. Additionally,
    meteorological conditions (temperature, humidity, wind) can affect the accuracy
    of measurements. Ground-based stations provide data for limited areas, which
    can create gaps in the assessment of air quality across broader regions. Therefore,
    diversifying data collection methods is essential.
