  question: How do international climate agreements play a role in combating climate
    change?
  information: "International climate agreements set targets for greenhouse gas emissions
    reductions and promote collaboration among countries. The Paris Agreement aims
    to limit global warming to below 2 \xB0C, while the Kyoto Protocol established
    binding emission reduction targets for specific countries. These agreements are
    crucial for coordinating global responses to climate change."
