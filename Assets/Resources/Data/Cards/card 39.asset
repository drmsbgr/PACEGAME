  question: What are the new technological trends in air quality monitoring?
  information: Several new trends are emerging in air quality monitoring technology.
    High-resolution satellite systems allow for the observation of large areas, and
    integrating air quality data with geographic information systems (GIS) enhances
    spatial analysis capabilities. Additionally, mobile sensors and smartphone applications
    enable individuals to track air quality in real-time.
