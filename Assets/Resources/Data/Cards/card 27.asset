  question: How do meteorological factors affect air quality?
  information: Meteorological conditions can significantly impact air quality. For
    instance, temperature inversions can trap cold air near the surface, causing
    pollutants to accumulate in that layer. High humidity levels can influence ozone
    levels, while wind speed and direction affect the dispersion and concentration
    of pollutants. Consequently, air quality predictions are closely linked to weather
    conditions.
