  question: How is deforestation related to climate change?
  information: Deforestation occurs when trees are cut down or burned, contributing
    to increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Trees play a crucial role
    in capturing carbon; therefore, their loss exacerbates climate change. Protecting
    and restoring forests is essential for mitigating these effects.
