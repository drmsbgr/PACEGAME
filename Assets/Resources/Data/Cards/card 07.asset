  question: How do human activities impact the health of marine ecosystems?
  information: Human activities negatively impact marine ecosystem health through
    pollution, overfishing, and climate change. Pollution diminishes water quality
    and threatens marine life, while overfishing disrupts population dynamics. Climate
    change can alter sea temperatures, causing imbalances in ecosystem health.
