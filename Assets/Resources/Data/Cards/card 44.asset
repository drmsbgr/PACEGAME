  question: Can you provide examples of the impacts of climate change on ecosystems?
  information: Climate change affects ecosystems in various ways. For instance, coral
    reefs are particularly sensitive to temperature increases, leading to coral bleaching.
    Additionally, rising sea levels threaten coastal ecosystems like wetlands, while
    forests and desert regions experience changes due to rising temperatures and
    altered precipitation patterns.
