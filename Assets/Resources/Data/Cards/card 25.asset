  question: What are the health effects of exposure to air pollution?
  information: Exposure to air pollution can lead to numerous health issues. Acute
    effects include eye irritation, sore throat, and respiratory problems. Long-term
    exposure can result in serious health concerns, such as asthma, bronchitis, heart
    diseases, strokes, and lung cancer. Vulnerable populations, such as children
    and the elderly, are particularly susceptible to the impacts of air pollution.
