  question: What is biodiversity, and why is it crucial for ecosystems?
  information: Biodiversity refers to the variety of different species and genetic
    diversity within a specific ecosystem. It is vital for ecosystems because this
    diversity supports food web interactions, ecosystem services (such as soil fertility
    and water filtration), and resilience against environmental changes.
