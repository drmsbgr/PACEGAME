  question: How does urbanization affect air quality?
  information: Urbanization can negatively impact air quality due to increased transportation
    and industrial activities. A higher population density leads to more vehicles
    on the road, increasing exhaust emissions and air pollutants. Additionally, construction
    activities and energy consumption contribute to declining air quality. However,
    sustainable urban planning practices, such as preserving and enhancing green
    spaces, can help improve air quality.
