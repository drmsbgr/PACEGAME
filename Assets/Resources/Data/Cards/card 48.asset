  question: What are the negative impacts of climate change on the agricultural sector?
  information: Climate change threatens agricultural productivity by causing extreme
    weather events (such as droughts and floods) and increasing pest and disease
    prevalence. Rising temperatures can negatively affect crop development, leading
    to reduced yields. This situation poses serious threats to food security.
