  question: What are the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems?
  information: Climate change can lead to rising ocean temperatures, causing acidification
    and destabilizing ecosystems. This may negatively affect the reproduction and
    development processes of marine organisms. Additionally, rising sea levels threaten
    coastal ecosystems and the services they provide.
