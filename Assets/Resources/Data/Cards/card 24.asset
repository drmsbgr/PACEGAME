  question: Why is the Air Quality Index (AQI) important?
  information: The Air Quality Index (AQI) provides a quick and understandable assessment
    of air quality. It is calculated based on the concentrations of specific pollutants
    (PM2.5, PM10, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide).
    High AQI values indicate harmful air conditions, alerting the public to avoid
    certain activities.
