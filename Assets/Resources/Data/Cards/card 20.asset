  question: Why is the balance of marine ecosystems critically important?
  information: The balance of marine ecosystems is vital for the functioning of food
    chains, the preservation of biodiversity, and climate regulation. This balance
    ensures the sustainability of marine life and allows human populations to benefit
    from ecosystem services. Disruption of this balance threatens the health of oceans
    and adversely affects human societies
