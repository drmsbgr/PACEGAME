  question: What benefits do reforestation efforts provide in ecosystem protection?
  information: "Reforestation involves planting trees in deforested or degraded areas.
    This practice increases carbon absorption, helping to mitigate climate change,
    enhances \r\nlocal biodiversity, and reduces soil erosion. It also improves water
    cycles and provides habitat for wildlife.\r\n"
