  question: What are carbon sinks, and how do they impact climate change?
  information: Carbon sinks are ecosystems that absorb more carbon dioxide from the
    atmosphere than they release, such as forests, oceans, and agricultural lands.
    These sinks play a critical role in reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in
    the atmosphere, making their conservation and enhancement vital for combating
    climate change.
