  question: How do ocean currents affect the carbon cycle?
  information: Ocean currents play a crucial role in transporting carbon between
    surface and deep waters. Warm surface waters tend to release carbon dioxide into
    the atmosphere, while cold deep waters act as carbon reservoirs. This mechanism
    is critical for the oceans' carbon absorption capacity, contributing to global
    climate regulation.
