  question: What are the economic costs associated with measures taken to address
    climate change?
  information: "While the initial costs of climate change mitigation measures can
    be high, studies show that these investments can lead to significant savings
    by reducing the adverse effects of climate change over the long term. Investments
    in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to sustainable energy sources,
    and adopting low-carbon technologies can also create economic growth and job
    opportunities.\r"
