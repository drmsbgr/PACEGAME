  question: What is the role of monitoring ozone levels in evaluating air quality?
  information: Ozone, when present at ground level, is considered a harmful pollutant.
    It forms in the presence of sunlight and reacts with nitrogen oxides (NOx) and
    volatile organic compounds (VOCs). High levels of ozone can exacerbate respiratory
    problems and pose risks, particularly to children, the elderly, and asthma patients.
    Therefore, monitoring ozone levels is critical for determining air quality.
