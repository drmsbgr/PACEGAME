  question: How does climate change affect species distribution, and what threats
    does this pose to ecosystems?
  information: Climate change alters temperature and precipitation patterns, which
    can impact the habitats of many species. Some species may migrate to cooler climates,
    while others may struggle to adapt. This can lead to local extinctions and disrupt
    the balance within ecosystems.
