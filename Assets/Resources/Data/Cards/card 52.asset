  question: What are the social and economic impacts of climate change on vulnerable
    communities?
  information: Vulnerable communities are disproportionately affected by climate
    change, facing increased natural disasters that threaten food and water security,
    along with rising health issues and displacement risks. These impacts weaken
    their ability to cope with climate change and raise concerns about social justice
    and equity.
