  question: How does the presence of particulate matter (PM) affect air quality?
  information: Particulate matter (PM) consists of tiny solid or liquid particles
    suspended in the air and is often generated from human activities (industry,
    vehicle exhaust, construction, etc.) or natural events (wildfires, volcanic eruptions).
    PM can enter the respiratory system and cause health problems such as asthma,
    bronchitis, and lung cancer. Additionally, PM can negatively impact the environment,
    affecting plant health and water quality.
