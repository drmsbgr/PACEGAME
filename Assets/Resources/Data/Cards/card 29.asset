  question: How do emission regulations improve air quality?
  information: Emission regulations are legal frameworks designed to limit the release
    of specific pollutants from industrial and transportation sectors. These regulations
    encourage the adoption of cleaner technologies and energy sources while aiming
    to reduce the environmental impact of vehicles and industrial facilities. As
    a result, such policies contribute to improving air quality and protecting public
    health.
