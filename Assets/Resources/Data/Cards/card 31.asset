  question: What human activities contribute to air pollution?
  information: Air pollution is directly related to human activities such as industrial
    emissions, transportation activities, agricultural practices (especially chemical
    use), and the burning of fossil fuels. These activities lead to the release of
    pollutants like carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and PM into
    the atmosphere. Therefore, regulating human activities and transitioning to more
    sustainable practices is vital for improving air quality.
