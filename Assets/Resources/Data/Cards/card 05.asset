  question: How do oceans play a role in carbon dioxide absorption?
  information: Oceans absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,
    acting as a significant carbon sink. This process helps mitigate climate change
    by reducing atmospheric carbon levels. Oceans, through phytoplankton and other
    mechanisms, contribute to the regulation of carbon dioxide levels, which is essential
    for maintaining ecological balance.
