  question: How do greenhouse gases differ from other air pollutants?
  information: Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and
    nitrous oxide (N2O), trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to climate change.
    In contrast, other air pollutants generally reduce air quality and have harmful
    health effects at the ground level. For example, particulate matter can lead
    to respiratory diseases, while greenhouse gases primarily impact climate.
