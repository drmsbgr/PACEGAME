  question: What are the environmental effects of acid rain?
  information: Acid rain occurs when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere
    combine with water vapor to form acidic compounds. The effects of acid rain can
    disrupt the pH balance in aquatic ecosystems, render soils acidic, and damage
    forests. This can lead to loss of vegetation, declining water quality, and reduced
    biodiversity.
